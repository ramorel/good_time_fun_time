## What is this?

This repo is a collection of projects I've done just for fun and for practice. Mostly related to educational issues. 

- [**Visualizing chater school enrollment over time.**](https://github.com/ramorel/good_time_fun_time/blob/master/R/charter_growth.Rmd) Charter schools are quasi-public schools and a popular, if controversial, type of school choice policy (compared to, say, voucher programs, which are less popular and even more controversial). Charter schools have expanded a great deal over the last two decades, with more and more states adoption charter school laws. There are still a few holdouts and even is states with long standing charter school laws are limited enrollment. Visualizing the share of students enrolled in charter schools gives a quick and informative glimpse of the landscape of charter schools in the United States. See [here](https://ramorel.github.io/files/charter_growth.html).

- [**Visualizing the spread of test boycotts in New York State.**](https://github.com/ramorel/good_time_fun_time/blob/master/R/map_of_test_boycotts.Rmd). See [here](https://ramorel.github.io/files/map_of_test_boycotts.html).
